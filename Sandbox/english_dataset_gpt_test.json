{"query": "In February, I developed a pathological fracture of my fifth metatarsal closest to the toe. The md placed me in a plaster cast followed by a boot. I was out of work for about a month. I returned to work in March wearing the boot. However, I am on my feet quite a bit (walking, standing,etc./ I am a nurse), and the pain and swelling increased over the next month. The MD decided to do surgery. I had surgery on April 28th, where the MD found that I actually had two fractures present with bone fragments which he removed. About two weeks after the stitches were removed, the incision opened up. I was placed on antibiotics for two weeks. After the first two weeks, the incision was still not healing, so the MD decided to debride it in the office and place me on a second round of antibiotics. The incision appears to be healed now, however, it is very sensitive and I continue to have swelling, muscle spasms, and pain in the toe and side of my foot. I have had a bone scan which showed hot spots in the area of the fracture and the ankle, which the MD said were from surgery. I just had an EMG performed today, because the MD feels the pain in my foot is being caused from my back. I have also, been seeing a chiropractor, who feels the two are not connected. Now the MD wants me to see a vascular surgeon because he thinks I may have Raynaud s that is causing my pain. I feel like we are just grasping at straws and I am very frustrated, exhausted, and depressed. Please help!", "response": "Dear Sir/Madam have gone through your query and read your symptoms. In my opinion,first you fail to tell what was the pathology behind your fracture. Secondly what was the surgery done, was any grafting done, or ant wire put, also has the fracture healed now, your skin can be sensitive due to small nerve that become sensitive due to surgical trauma, I would also warn you towards developing CRPS where in the skin becomes hypersensitive, swollen and shiny, this occurs because of sympathetic overactivity. If pain is your main concern, I suggest you to consult a Pain specialist. If you can provide me answers I can help you out. I hope that answers your query. If your want any more clarification, contact me back. Chat Doctor."}
{"query": "Hello Dr. I have gone through 10 radiation treatments to my brain and was weaning off the steroids a few days ago I lost the ability to talk intermitted, appears when I am stressed, and now experiencing a burning feeling in my right hand and right side of face also intermitted it is common", "response": "Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Radiation treatment causes some functional derangement of any kind of cell/tissue partly due to swelling of the cells and partly due to the damage to normal cells as well. Therefore, your present symptoms could either be due to the neural cells being affected by the radiation treatment or could be due to the original condition for which radiation treatment was advised to you. This effect could be transitional or permanent depending on the extent of its effect. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for some euro vitamins, along with a referral to a neurologist if the symptoms increase. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in solving this problem. Thanks for using the Chat Doctor forum for your health query. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."}

Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection as lung infection is common after pleurisy (infection of pleura) and can cause similar symptoms.

Accidentally teeth of lower jaw strike upper lip and cause bump in that area due to excessive accumulation of collagen fibers in that area. It could be due to herpes simplex virus infection which can cause cold sore in that area. If you have excessive sun exposure then this blister could be because of that. Need not panic about it.

{"query": "My  3 year old daughter over the last 5 days; has a bad cold (on her third day of antibiotics), fever for 4 days (fever broke yesterday), pink eye (cleared up now with drops), threw up once, swollen gums, sores all over her inner lips, bloody gums and lips, white coated tongue, will not eat because her mouth hurts.   How should I treat her mouth???", "response": "Hi. Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern... As per your complaint all the symptoms that you have indicated of having a pink eye along with fever, cold, sores in mouth and swollen gums are all due to Viral infection leading to Viral Conjunctivitis and Viral Gingivostomatitis. Due to infection, the immunity of the body goes low and also in such an early age the immune system is not completely developed, therefore, it is leading to fungal infection on the tongue causing Oral Thrush, and it is the cause for white coating over tongue. You should consult a Pediatrician and get him evaluated. In case if the Viral Infection is diagnosed you should give him Tylenol or Motrin for pain relief. Do cool compresses over gums for relief from Inflammation and reduction in swelling. In case of pain in the sores on tongue a numbing gel like Ora gel can be applied. In severe cases antiviral Oral and topical Medication like Acyclovir therapy is given to the patient to reduce the duration of illness... Give him cool and bland diet. Give him sufficient rest. Maintain a good Oral hygiene and brush his teeth twice a day using an ultra soft toothbrush. For thrush Candid mouth paint will help in resolving the infection. Hope this information helps.

{"query": "I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2002. Had lumpectomy lymph nodes does positive. I do not have a dr at this time but my affected breast is enlarged, sore and sounds funny but itches. Do you think this is something I sould worry about? as all mammograms have always come back clear.", "response": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It appears that you might have a fungal skin infection on the under side of the breast. A clinical examination is required to know if the itching is accompanied by fungal skin changes. The commonest infection is ring worm, and it occurs in the under side of breast where there is sweating and moisture deposition. This might not be related to breast tissue and therefore the mammogram comes normal. The treatment for breast fungal infection is application of antifungal treatment and wearing cotton inner clothes that will prevent sweat formation. If the ointment does not work in a confirmed fungal infection then a short course of oral antifungal medicine might be taken. Avoid scratching the area of breast where it is itching. Please do not worry."}

{"query": "Hello! I turn to you because I have posted my question to several sites with noanswer. I have a problem with breathing. I think about it all the time and thereason is that I feel the breathing is TOO LOW, it is like I cant get a fullbreath and my body doesnt move along when I breathe. It gives me a hard timebecause I feel like I have some kind of burden in my back. I feel like I have togasp for air because the air does not move when I breathe.It all started a year ago when I had a bad dream about having something in mythroat. Waking up I still had this sensation and started to panic. Anxiety wasgrowing and growing until I got hyperventilation - I felt very hot in rooms.Then my breathing suddenly started to CHANGE, I felt I could not go anymore ashigh as before. At one point there was extremely HOT until the sensation ofsurrounding air changed COMPLETELY. I felt like my breathing was fixed at alower level. Two months after the beginning of anxiety my breathing had a finalchange, becoming very low. I could not feel the air entering my lungs. It hasstayed like that after the end of last November. I still live but... this kindof breathing takes all the energy from me, causing extreme tiredness all thetime. Has anyone experienced something like that? The tests do not show there issomething wrong with breathing but I feel this is NOT RIGHT. This thought keepscreating constant anxiety for me. Have given up physical activities because theymagnify the feeling that I cant get the needed deep breath. Thus I am gainingmore and more weight. I dont have much hope left", "response": "Degree understand your concerns went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely opine that the problem you are facing now is of your own creation. Anxiety is such. Anxiety can make you feel and believe that you have serious physical problems. In actuality all these are simple creations of mind. More over you are trouble with health anxiety which can create chronic physical discomfort and pain without any physiological or neurological cause. In the beginning the patients never accept this fact. They go from doctor to doctor of every specialty. Every doctor tell the same, that this is due to anxiety. Only when there are no other options left, the patient admit. In your case, I am sure that you visited some doctors, and they advised you about anxiety. Therefore, follow the simple method of psychotherapy with dedication. You will be alright, for sure. If you still need my help, please describe the whole problem in detail and post a direct question to me. I shall definitely help you with psychotherapy techniques to overcome your problems. Hope this answers your query. Available for further clarifications. Good luck."}
{"query": "My newborn son had an abnormal CBC. They said his white blood cell levels indicated a *possible* infection, but that has not been confirmed. At one point, his sugar level was below 50. With both of these factors, they moved him to NICU. My wife and I are a little distraught because I don t feel like he should be in there. We have his blood sugar above 60 with my wife s breast feeding finally coming in like it s supposed to. And all that he really gets in NICU that isn t anywhere else is the antibiotics they have him on, which they administer once daily. She has been discharged as of yesterday, but they are saying he could be in here another week, making our entire visit here 10+ days. My first priority is the well-being of my son, and I would do anything and everything necessary to make sure he is in the best health. However, this really feels like a way to just get more money out of our insurance. Also, while he was in NICU without us, he was fed formula (strictly against our wishes and demands) several times, was put on the antibiotic IV and has had at least 2 X-Rays (that I know of) before we were told anything. In other words, they do things first and inform us later. No doctor has talked to me about any of this, and I want to get to the bottom of what I should or should not be doing. I just wanted some medical advice before I move forward with the hard questions.", "response": "Hello, Newborn infection is quite common and that requires iv antibiotics and NICU admission which is done here. They are tiny, so infection spreads very fast through blood and affects the lungs and intestine which is risky. To be sure about the status of these organs only x-ray is done which is perfect. And sometimes it becomes absolutely necessary and urgent, so it is always not possible for the neonatologists to ask the parents before doing some intervention.The same is true for milk also, when mothers expressed breast milk is not enough (which is quite normal for early days of post childbirth) and baby needs extra milk there is no other option except formula. With the entire IV lines direct breastfeeding is quite problematic at NICU. So, the babies treatment is going in the right way I feel. Hope I have answered your query.

Since a lung actually transfer oxygen from atmosphere to blood and CO2 from blood back to atmosphere. For this function it has so many air sacs called alveoli, and these alveoli keep increase in number till the child is 2 yrs. If a neonate gets any problem during neonatal (first month) period, there is almost damage to actual number of alveoli, so the function of lungs get disturbed (breathlessness, increase CO2 in body and increase need of O2 etc.). All these factors stimulate inflammatory response in lung tissues so recurrent breathlessness and infection can happen later in life. As respiratory initial virus is the commonest viral infection during this age, and needs to be carefully and symptomatically treated as chances of worsening of lung function increase having history of previous lung infection or aspiration or pneumonia.

{"query": "Hello, I am a 25 year old female. Two days ago I went to the ER bc my heart was pounding at a rate of 115 and I had shortness of breath. Once I rested I was ok. They didnt find anything and told me I probably had a flu. I just had another one of these episodes. I was laying un a blanket bc I was very cold and shivering. Then I felt like I was very nervous. My heart rate elevated. I tried to relax and fell asleep. When I awoke my heart was almost normal but I was very weak and shaking. My bp is also slightly elevated. Is this normal or is there reason for concern? Thank you.", "response": "Hello, Most likely this is anxiety and palpitations, however we need to rule out cardiac arrhythmia like PSV or atrial fibrillation, in which heart rate suddenly goes up and also suddenly decreases. Blood pressure falls during these episodes and one has dizziness, fainting, blackouts, sometimes syncope.  Usually ECG is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes. ECG done during episodes will show abnormality. You will need 24 hour holder monitoring. So visit nearby cardiologist for this investigation.  Also, hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done. Ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard.  Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab collar LA 20 mg once a day."}

{"query": "Prior to a work related car accident, I was in perfect health. I, was wearing my police uniform, when struck by an imparied driver in 2009. Since that day, while specialists were trying to figure out why I was in pain and having flu like symptoms monthly for a week at a time, and extreme pain and unusual fatigue my orth surgeon sent me for a bon scan where the nurse dropped the needle and put a belt around my elbows without steralizing. The next morning I woke up with 4 golf ball size lymph nodes under each arm. I had surgery and was diagnosed with a staph infection, I had home care for over two months while nurses changed the wound dressings under both underarms until they healed. As i tried to go for rehab to get strong again, I continue to crash and suffer from extreme exhaustion and was eventually told I had Fibromyalgia. I went to the USA for a 1 year treatment plan at the fibro and fatigue centre in Marietta Georgia. During my IV Injectoin treatments it was detected that I was not suffering from high blood pressure at rest 169 over 116 with a pulse of 90 to 98 at rest. Since then my dr prescribed blood pressure medicine and I take it but blood pressure is still 157 over 110 and my pulse is 104 at rest. What does this mean?? The last time I went to a heart specialst they advised that my heart was somewhat enlarged and mentioned left ventrical hypertrophy a condition athletes get as it happens over time with the heart having to pump harder. Any suggestions. I have been advised that Fibromyalgia causes our blood to thicken and less oxygen and a number of different theories. I really want to find the best doctor in the world to help me.

I understand your query and concern. High blood pressure with Left ventricular hypertrophy should be evaluated for Dilated cardiomyopathy. Best treatment for elevated blood pressure is through Chat Doctor. Before that adequate management and work up is needed.

Swelling is a protective mechanism for healing in the initial stages of injury. Since you are diabetic the healing can be little delayed due to the metabolic waste present in swelling. What you can do is to keep the leg elevated above the level of heart and perform some ankle toe movements as it will lead to pumping mechanism in the calf muscle and there by reduce the swelling. Also, perform straight leg raise as it will add on to the natural way of reducing the swelling. Doing a little general exercises will also help to make the cardio workout and there by improve the circulation and the swelling can be reduced.

The bleeding, swollen gums and pain could be because of the gum infection like pregnancy gingivitis.

But do not take any medicines by your own or without any prescription. The growth or ulcer could be a myogenic granuloma that occurs in pregnancy.

{"query": "I was licked by a dog in Thailand 7 days ago and now Im freaking out. Is it too late to get the vaccine? I was licked once on my finger (no open wound) by a normal looking dog. I washed my hands with an antibacterial gel (purell) immediately afterwards. I was not worried about it but when I got back from thailand (today) I realized a had a yeast infection (vaginal) and now Ill all worried it may have been caused by a weak immune system due to my body trying to fight off the rabies virus. Help!!", "response": "Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor, As you were licked by a dog according to WHO categories it is categorized into Cat II to which thorough wound washing along with minimum of three doses of antirabies vaccine should be taken. As you have washed the wound thoroughly with antibacterial gel it will wash off the rabies virus if any present in the wound. As you are mentioning regarding the fungal infection of the vagina it is no where concerned with the dog bite. Rabies is a disease which is 100% fatal, but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment. So the genital fungal infection is common in females because of the normal anatomy of the female reproductive system. Thank you."}
{"query": "I am 76. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. Had a lumpectomy. More tumors found, and one large against chest wall. Mastectomy. Had Chemo. Took Arimidex (spelling??) for 4 years 10 months. Was in pain everyday. The breast cancer had recurred., same side, chest wall. I had lumpectomy on Oct. 6. Pathology showed it to be recurrence. Pet scan showed no where else in my body. Nov. 12, more surgery to take out more tissue to try for clear margins. After healing, radiation. Then Arimidex for 5-10 years. Or Tomaxifen for 5-10 years. I know how I feel everyday on Arimidex. And, Tomaxifen causes heart problems. I have a family history of heart disease. I question...why bother after the surgery and radiation?? Thank you. Anne Marie Martainez", "response": "Hi Anne Marie Martinez, The breast cancer is a systemic disease i.e. it involves all the system in the body. Surgery and radiation will only take care of disease in the breast. There is a spread of small cancer cells to other parts of the body called micrometastases. So these cells can regrow later time. This is the reason the chemotherapy or hormonal therapy is recommended to kill these small cancer cells which cannot be detected by investigations. Hope I have answered your question"}
{"query": "I always feel like there is water or fluid on the side of my head. When I do get it out I can feel a cool feeling on the side of the head. I have trouble in the winter I have to where a cotton ball in that ear because it aches in the winter with the fluid in it. What do do think it is.", "response": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is likely that the nerves on your scalp on one side are more sensitive and give you a feeling of fluid collected below the skin. This might be due to irritation of nerves supplying the scalp. Water or fluid inside the brain is a normal feature and everyone has it. That water is much deeply located and will never communicate with the outside surface of brain. Also, the brain is protected by a strong skull and over that there is scalp skin. In this way it is not the water inside your head but some sort of discomfort arising due to nerve stimulation in head and face region. Please consult a doctor and get a neurological clinical examination done. This will help in arriving at a confirmed diagnosis. Doing a CT scan might be indicated depending on clinical findings and to see if there is any structural changes under the scalp causing that feeling. Please do not worry."}

Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would first advise you not to eat anything from outside specially the fast and fried food.

Further management would depend on the result of the investigations.

My cardiologist gave me lisonpril to take when I need it. For the past 4 weeks, I have had to take it everyday and still doesnt entirely stop the palpitations. When it really gets bad, it gives me the urge to cough. Is this to me expected with MVP?", "response": "Hello. Welcome to Chat Doctor. Thank you for your question. I understand your concern. First, I suppose your doctor also informed you that lisinopril does not exert such effect like lowering the heart rate, thus reducing the palpitations. Also, lisinopril and other Prius can cause Chat Doctor.  I am assuming you had high blood pressure and that is why your doctor prescribed lisinopril. In this point that we are standing, I would recommend you to do an EKG, to clear what these palpitations are; an echocardiogram to re-evaluate your mitral valve prolapse and if it is causing mitral regurgitation (returning of the blood through the mitral valve during systole, when it is normally shut) and, if so, what grade is it and does it correlate with symptoms; also, a 24-hour Holder rhythm registration, to see how often the palpitations do happen during a day. It is only when these tests are performed, you can discuss treatment strategies with your curing doctor. I hope I was helpful with my answer. Feel free to contact me again. Best regards,"}

Thanks for help in advance.", "response": "Hello, I can understand your concern. The first possibility from your description of the swelling and location seems to be presence of authors ulcer or canker sore. However, these ulcers are very painful, and you are not having much pain which negates the possibility. Secondly, the location you have described has a minor sublingual salivary gland. If this gland or duct passing saliva is traumatized due to some reason, it can develop a swelling. This swelling usually hurts while eating and otherwise does not hurt. Thirdly, it could be a cyst developed in the area. Cysts are fluid filled cavities that are lined by the epithelium or a small lining of cells. Cysts are painless unless infected. However, it is very difficult reach a diagnosis until the swelling is examined. I would advise you to visit a dentist for the examination of the swelling regarding its texture, exact location, symptoms, color and size. You might have to go for blood test and biopsy. Based on the examination and test results, diagnosis can be made and management can be advised. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing Chat Doctor. Take care. Best,"}

Irrational fear, false beliefs, paranoid ideas, hearing voices, etc. are indicative of a type of psychiatric problem called psychosis. Now, psychosis can be due to various psychiatric illnesses or sometimes, due to medical causes also. Such psychiatric illnesses may include delusional disorder, severe depressive disorder, schizophrenia or late-stage dementia. Sometimes, sudden onset of psychosis in an elderly person can be due to a primary medical cause or a brain pathology. Certain medication like steroids, can also result in the development of psychotic symptoms. You need to take her to a psychiatrist who will be able to assess her in detail to determine the probable cause for these psychotic symptoms. If he suspects any medical cause or brain pathology, then she may have to undergo a few tests and maybe, a brain scan to detect any such causes. Treatment will also depend on the nature of the cause. For example, if she has a primary medical pathology, then that has to be treated first. If her psychosis is part of a depressive disorder, then she may require anti-depressants, in addition to the treatment for the psychotic symptoms. If it is part of a delusional disorder or schizophrenia, then anti-psychotic medication would be the primary line of treatment. All the best. -"}

Since you have undergone a EKG, stress thallium, CT Anglo all of this collectively almost rule out a coronary heart disease. It's correct that breast may shadow CT images, but stress thallium is quite a sensitive test and that coupled with a normal ct Anglo increases the diagnosis rate. So as of now there is nothing to worry about from the heart side. Still if you are insecure you can undergo a catheter (conventional) angiogram, which is somewhat more invasive procedure. Alternatively try a short course of antacids for 14 days to rule out hyperacidity as a cause of your symptoms. Thank you"}

It can be probably due to nerve damage caused either during injection or extraction. So first consult an Oral Surgeon and get evaluated. Anxiety ray should be done for confirmation.

I think that you were advised, on discharge, to have periodical cardiac stress tests, 1, 3 and 6 months after the stent implantation.

I am feelin a lil nausea as well. And my thighs n legs are hurting.", "response": "Here you have mention two issues that is back pained with thigh pain as well abdominal pain with cramping feeling in abdomen also associated with nausea. Usually this both will not be associated to each other. You can do treatment first which ever is disturbing you more. Check either the back pain started first or abdominal pain started first. If you used to have regular back pain problem then it will be related to either back muscle weakness or it can be related to spinal level issues like loss off curve, lumbar spondylitis, lumbar disc issues etc.However conformation can be done by specialist like orthopedic and physiotherapist with physical examination, and they may ask you to go for MRI of lumbosacral spine. And then based on report doctor will guide you treatment. If there is major problem at spinal level then it will be surgical correction and if there is mild to moderate issue it will be treated with physiotherapy exercises and treatment along with some medication as per your body need like calcium, vitamin D, muscle relaxants etc. You can also use hot pack for some more relief in pain. For your abdominal pain I suggest if it is first time it may be gastritis also so change your food habits. Do not take oily and spicy food. Maintain food timing. Keep water intake of 3-4 liter per day. And do walking regularly in night before you go to sleep. Have one anti acid pill daily morning with empty stomach for 15\\u00a0days and see how you feel. If it goes in 2 to 3 days well and good or else you need to visit a physician and may need to do ultrasound abdomen to rule out other possibility. Later can plan treatment as per the ultrasound report. Possibility is many with abdominal pain like gastritis, gastric ulcer, kidney stone since it is also associated with back pain, gallbladder stone, liver issues etc. However the conformation can be done only with ultrasound and proper physical examination only.

Ill break down your question into some key components.1. A 28-year-old with physical limitation unusual for him. The probability of coronary heart disease is low but not zero and the treadmill provides useful information. It lets you know that his limitation is not severe and risk of near term death is not high affording time for deliberation, elective evaluation and choices in the next step for arriving at a diagnosis.2. The ECG is abnormal in D3 (frontal plane lead III) with exercise but rapidly returns to normal. This is frequently a false positive finding and does not automatically indicate arterial disease.3. The treating physicians are sufficiently suspicious to recommend invasive testing. Oddly, one of the most difficult things to test in medicine but also one of the most important, is the physicians' suspicion after interview and examination. Therefore, the recommendation to look for additional information should be followed. The options that should be discussed with the treating doctor (to be sure that he or she has the information needed to make good decisions) are 1. Additional physiological testing performed with imaging methods such as nuclear imaging or echocardiography.  2. Non-invasive angiography using CT scanning."}

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. The transmission pathways of HBV are via infected blood (e.g. transfusion) or blood contained equipments(unsterile needles e.g. having a tattoo, piercing, or having dental procedures etc.) and infected body fluids (unprotected sex). Regarding the possible treatment of your child, I would strongly recommend to you to have prenatal care because in uteri infection is uncommon, representing no more than 5 percent of perinatal HBV infections. With such a presentation on my clinic I would recommend Hepatitis B Vaccine - first dose of the vaccine series and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (BIG) - 1 or 2 doses to be given immediately in the delivery room (or within the first 12 hours of life), then there is more than a 95% chance that a newborn will avoid a chronic HBV infection.

{"query": "My wife has Polycystic ovary syndrome and has irregular periods since early age (18 years old). She used to get period irregular periods in intervals of 1-3 months. In this regard, we visited Fortis Mumbai and started the treatment there. 1. At Fortis Mumbai, we were suggested to take female contraceptives for 3-6 months with the hope that it might help to regularize periods and try naturally afterwards. We tried for 3 months after that but this did not help as there were muliple follicles and mature follicle/ egg formation. 2. Thereafter, we were suggested to go for Clomid to stimulate ovolution. We tried this method for another 6 months but this did not help inspite of increased dosage. The scans during this time still reflected multiple follicules and no single mature follicle (upto maximum 10 mm size). 3. After that, we shifted to Bangalore with the focus of getting results in this regard and visited Fortis Bangalore . We were suggested to undergo various tests like fallopian tube ( HSG ), tuberculosis, semen analysis etc. All the tests were normal and she confirmed that Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCO ) is the only problem and that we should go for IUI as taking clomid for long duration may have side effects. 4. Since then my wife has undergone 3 IUIs and there has not been any positive results, with no explained reasons for failure. We have been suggested that we should try for 3-6 IUIs before thinking of IVF. During the 3 IUIs, genotropin injections was taken from Day 2 for 7-10 days and .The egg formation has been proper and size of mature follicule at the time time of doing IUI has been 18+mm. All this while, my wife is taking follic acid, metformin and CoQ tablets. However, at this point we thought of seeking your expert opinion since you are an expert in this field. Requests your inputs . what should be our next course of action and please suggest best doctor who is PCO specialist in Bangalore.", "response": "Hippos is the most common problem nowadays.

I do have a PayPal account but my Disability Benefits only comes in on Feb 27th. Sorry for wasting your time! Hi There! My sister is having a SCAN as the doctor wants to be sure she has diverticulitis ! I just found out about this (she went to the doctor s yesterday and is presently on a liquid diet until she can get her SCAN). The reason I contacted her today was because I am having problems myself with my bowels. I know for a fact I m low in fibre and I rarely drink water (just boring to drink). I wanted to know if taking probiotic supplements would help (as she swears by it)! I looked up this disease and I couldn t believe it! My systems also came on, all of a sudden. I haven t voided in almost 2 weeks (we went to Red Lobster for seafood). There was 2 days where I had such severe diareah but it was just liquid form and I only went once. What I couldn t believe is that it came on all of a sudden for my sister as well as myself (I have all the symptions too). To make things worse, I suffer from depression, severe anxiety and panic attacks and worse of all.... agoraphobia . My daughter and her 15 yr old Grandson just got tested for a bowel problem (which also sounds like this disease). The only reason I want him to get a second opinion is because, (you won t believe this), my husband has Chrohn s Disease. He only has about 4 inches of bowel left but he is in remission. He was diagnosted in his mid 20 s (and is now 57). He now has a permanent colostomy as the disease was all in his rectum, which had to be removed. They didn t have the medication to treat Chrohn s like they do today. His youngest sister was then diagnosed with Chrohn s disease about 5 years ago. T She s having a hard time and won t even consider a temporary colostomy to give her bowels a break! This is all too weird! As I did research, it is a type of bowel disease where most doctors feel there is no cure for...Wow!! I do have a question", "response": "Hi...thanks for the query! The simplest answer to your query is Yes! Though not proven conclusively, but probiotic supplements are helpful in Crohn's disease & are definitely good to prevent problems like constipation, diverticulitis. Secondly as you are suffering from anxiety disorder, it is very likely that sudden onset of your symptoms similar to those of your sister are manifestation of underlying anxiety only!

For this reason, I would like to directly review his cardiac ultrasound and ECG, coupled with blood lab tests (and cardiac enzymes), if you can upload them for a more professional opinion. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards,"}
{"query": "hello sir, My name is Arjun. I am moved to bangalore 8 months back. I started having cold regularly in these 8 months. Now for the the past 10 days I am having severe cold and it is not going away. I am taking tablets like cold flu and cold act. Also having benadryl. Can you plz suggest me some doctor whom I can visit for this problem.", "response": "Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. Understanding your concern. As per your query you have severe cold which could be due to upper respiratory track infection specially viral infection, and it could be sinusitis. It is due to impaired immunity of body and increased susceptibility of getting infected. Need not worry. I would suggest you to do warm saline gargles and Betadine gargles alternatively, avoid eating spicy and heavy food and consult ENT specialist for proper examination. Doctor may order throat swab test, vial culture test and blood test. Doctor may prescribe anti-viral along with anti-inflammatory Levocetrizine. Doctor may also refer you to gastroenterologist if he/she find problem to be related with acid reflux. Hope your concern has been resolved. Get Well Soon. Best Wishes,"}
{"query": "I have a racing heart and my dr. Says its anxiety, but its all the time, now my asthma is worse and prednisone, advair  xopenex ventolin dont work. Im on clonozapam which only allows me to sleep 3-4 hours per night and then my racing heart wakes me. Was on thryoid meds last year which caused thryoid storm and had severe heart pounding. My dr. Said it was thryoid storm, the ER doc said it was panic attacks, had several heart tests, lung X-ray all normal, why does it seem that my heart racing and asthma coincide. I started taking 1500 mg of magnesium and 1200 mg calcium to help with the cough spasms . It helps. Im fine during the night and morning with no asthma symptoms, but it starts around 3pm until bedtime. No one seems to have answers for me. They even sent me to a psychiatrist and all he did was double the clonazapam at night so the panic attacks didnt wake me which worked for awhile, now I hardly sleep at all and my heart races constantly but not pounding like when I was in thryoid drugs. Im tired of feeling this way. Ive had a long history of asthma in the past, but no occurrence in about 5 years after having my stomach stapled around my esophogus due to severe reflux which fixed the problem. I know I have allergies. Ever since working outside in the spring, its been bad and cant seem to calm the asthma down.", "response": "Hi, Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Racing heart beats may due to cardiac cause, thyroid hormone imbalance or due to hypoxia due to asthma. So get done ECG, echocardiography, thyroid profile, blood sugar level, serum electrolytes, Hologram and spirometry once to diagnose the cause. Keep checking TSH levels once every 6 months. For Asthma, it seems you are not controlled. So get back with the symptoms and your treatment history and Chat Doctor.  If we cure asthma then all other problems will be cured with this if this is the basic problem. Have adequate regular sleep, plenty of fluids, nutritious diet with required calorie and regular outdoor exercises for your wellbeing. Hope I answered your question. Get back with the reports. Consult your doctor for further management. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries. Wish you good health. Take care. Regards"}
{"query": "sir actually i got married last year june.. because of the irregular periods i didnt get pregnat.. but consulting with the doctor for last one year.. after all the test they have told tat there is problem in body finally they suggested to take ubithene50 and glycomet.. sir i wanna know about importance of those tabulats..", "response": "Hiii, Welcome to Chat Doctor. You are probably suffering from ovulatory cycle which is most commonly associated with irregular period. Ubiphene 50 contains Camphene citrate which is an ovulation inducer and used in infertility associated with ovulation dysfunction. Glycomet 500\\u00a0mg contains Metformin which is used to overcome insulin resistance or hyperglycemia, more commonly associated with Ovarian Cyst (PCs). Do regular exercise, take healthy diet and avoid stress. Regularize your period and use ovulation kit to predict ovulation time. Then do sex timely. It increases pregnancy rate. Be well."}
{"query": "I am 25 years old and was shot in the arm back in june. Since I have been on tecta due to a bleeding ulcer and without it I vomit non stop and wind up in the ER for a night or two. I am wanting to get pregnant and am wondering what I would do as I see tecta is not safe for pregnancy? Also I was wondering, I take morphine pills once in awhile for the severe pain I still get in my arm (the gun shot shattered my elbow and I now have rods and plates in there) and I read that is safe, as well as injectable gravol when my stomach gets too bad...", "response": "Dear patient, Thanks for the query. No medication is absolutely safe in pregnancy, but there are some that have to be avoided if possible (those that are Class C) or completely at all costs (those that are Class X). Class A are those that have been shown to be \\\"safe\\\" in humans (very few, like acetaminophen). Most meds fall into Class B; these we try not to use during the first trimester, but if there is a medical need that exceeds the risk they could be used. Yours truly, Chat Doctor."}

This has occured a few months ago and last year. A few months ago I went a week having dizzy spells so strong unable to lift my head, then irregular heart beat that caused lost breath. Last week the pinching in my heart last for 3 mins. then palpatations or racing of the heart and Ive been exhausted ever since. Tired even though I sleep 8-9 hours per night.", "response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since you are having strong family history of heart diseases, we should definitely rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms. So consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and Holder monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ECG). If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm.Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}
{"query": "Hi. I have a whole series of symptoms that have arisen over the past few weeks. Abdominal pain . Bloating . Occasional shortness of breath. Constipation. Uterine bleeding. And in the last week, a rather large lump underneath my left ribcage. I ve had a pelvic ultrasound. No ovarian cancer . Still waiting on uterine cancer biopsy. And my white blood cell count is elevated. No one knows what it is.", "response": "Hi there, depending on your age abdominal pain with bloating and bleeding cyclically can signify normal menstrual cycle with dysmenhorea. If you are post menopausal then you may need to worry and get a pelvic ultrasound along with PAP smear exam and a physical exam done by a gynecologist. Certain tumor markers like CA-19,CEA can also be done. Elevated white cell count signifies an infective state and so you will need to get a differential count and a peripheral smear study done. An abdominal ultrasound could be done to know the origin of the lump that you felt beneath your rib cage and whether it is significant in your present history. The best thing to do would be to consult a general physician and get any investigations done according to his advice. Take care."}

{"query": "Im experiencing dizziness, that come with feeling to faint, light headed, rubbery legs, sweat and shortness of breath where I gasp for air daily & pretty much at the same time for a wk now. No possibility of pregnancy, blood work was done about a month ago & all came back normal", "response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, we should first rule out heart and lung diseases. So first get done ECG and 2d echo. Then get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If all these are normal then no need to worry about major heart and lung related diseases. Sometimes stress, anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.

{"query": "For about two weeks I ve been having pain in my upper right side on my ribs, about three inches below my arm pit. I haven t had any injury to that side. Taking Advil and Aleve helps, but if I move a certain way, it can take my breath away. It s more of a sharp pain. I would think this is what an injured rib feels like, but I haven t done anything for it to be injured.", "response": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. In your case we need to rule out pleurisy first. Pleurisy is inflammation of pleura. The sharp pain is seen in pleurisy. So get done chest x-ray to rule out possible causes for pleurisy (pneumonia, tuberculosis, pleural effusion) etc. If chest x-ray is normal then no need to worry much for pleurisy. Muscle pain can be the cause. So start painkiller and muscle relaxant. Avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting. Don't worry, you will be alright."}
{"query": "Hello, My daughter is 5 yrs old yesterday morning around 5 am she woke me up saying her stomach was hurting my youngest daughter 2 yrs old was sick had some kinda stomach virus that included vomiting, fever, no appetites a cold the usual stuff it comes with so I assumed my 5 yr old got it as well she s having the same symptoms she keeps complaining about her stomach hurting bad, her arms hurting, itchy throat so I think she s meaning sore throat, she has a cough too the stomach pains come & go she ll be fine for awhile then all the sudden she s crying hurting again my youngest daughter wasn t completely feeling the way she does I ve been doing research to see what I could be I ve seen it could be a stomafluch flu the doctor office is closed today I know they say it has to play itself out I just wanna help her could you give me any advice of what it possibly could be & what I could do to help if I can.?", "response": "Hi... This looks like viral induced vomiting and diarrhea and pharyngitis. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15\\u00a0mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500\\u00a0mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Meftal-P contains Metonymic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Metal. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer. Wish your kid good health."}
{"query": "i am suffring from dilated cardiomyopathy since last two years  i feel tired and breathlessness in slitest exertion, can not walk even 50 steps feeling heavy in stomac as if there is fluied in te stomac  feel dificulty in sleeping on both the sides only can sleep flat on the back dificulty in breathing after fast walking", "response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can cause reduction in heart functions. This can cause fluid retention in the body. This fluid can accumulate in lungs, abdomen and legs. In lungs, it causes pulmonary edema and this can cause breathlessness on exertion.  In abdomen, it causes ascites and this cause heaviness in abdomen. So you should consult cardiologist and get done 2d echo to measure heart function. If it is reduced then you will need diuretics to reduce fluid retention. After diuretics, you will mostly improve. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."}
{"query": "I took my friend to the hospital emergency room about 4 days ago because of abdominal pain.  Her lipase level was 900.  She admits to drinking at least 6 beers every night.  She has also had stomach ulcers in the past.  The Dr in the hospital told her she needed to quit drinking as the high lipase levels were likely a result of excessive drinking.   Yesterday, her primary care Dr took blood tests again and said that all levels are normal but did not specifically mention lipase.  He thinks its her ulcer returning.  How do we tell whether its pancriititis or an ulcer.  She of course thinks its an ulcer.  Im concerned about her drinking.", "response": "Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. One fact is sure which you should specifically counsel your friend is to leave alcohol totally, as irrespective of whether it is pancreatitis or a gastric ulcer, alcohol is detrimental and the cause of both these conditions. The pain could have been due to pancreatitis de Nova or the gastric ulcer penetrating the posterior wall of the stomach to make the pancreas inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. In both the cases the serum amylase, and lipase could be increased along with alcoholism. However, high levels like a lipase of 900 points more towards a pancreatitis. If I were your doctor, after her condition is stabilized in the hospital, I would refer her to a gastroenterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of her old gastric ulcer. And I would also ask her for an absolute NO to alcohol to prevent further damage to the pancreas which sometimes results in very poor prognosis. She should continue with her treatment advised by the doctors of the hospital. I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts. Thanks for choosing Chat Doctor to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Chat Doctor."}

She is under no medication. Suggest some course of action please!", "response": "Hi, Unfortunately, a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia is made on clinical grounds, which can be supported by genetic studies which may elucidate the specific TYPE she could be suffering from, however, no medication is currently available to treat the condition.  Depending upon her other symptoms such as headaches (if associated), eye movement abnormalities (if associated), dizziness there could be medications to treat or ameliorate.

Please help me anyone in any state any where.", "response": "Hi, thank-you for providing the brief history. As you have osteomyelitis this may be due to either infection or may be due to inflammation of the bone marrow. A thorough clinical examination and some blood routine tests needs to be performed and understand the possible cause. If the infection has reached the bone than may be with the proper understanding of the pathology may be a THR can help. Also, an IV antibiotic for helping reduce the inflammation and infections should help further. A Dedicated team of rehabilitation needs to be approached for further management. If the team performs uniformly than your problem can be resolved. In my practical experience the approach is made uniformly with the help of the team members and coordination. Most patients respond well and healing is expected sooner. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor."}

I just had my periods two days ago. Could you please advise me what should I do now? Am I safe? Thank you", "response": "Since you had your period, it sounds like you are safe now, and you should just continue with the patch as usual.  In general though, you do need to put the patch on after no more than one week patch free, an even a few days delay can cause you to ovulate and the chances of pregnancy increase.

Within a day or so the pain was down to a dull ache but that aching has spread to my entire lower bain and groin area. I also have chills and tenderness and bad fatigue but with no fever. I was getting over a cold when this happened, but Im not sure if I feel awful because of the cold or if something internally is wrong now.", "response": "Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the Chat Doctor. From the history, I think PIED should be ruled out. You can have a X-ray of Dorsal and LS spine to rule out any bony abnormality and change in disk space.  If the radiating pain persists you will also need MRI of the affected region of the spine. For the time being you can have analgesics (tab paracetamol 500 mg SOS, at least 6 hr interval should be maintained), a muscle relaxant (Cyclobenzaprine 15 mg or Thiocolchicoside 4 mg twice daily) and rest. These are for symptomatic relief. For definitive management you should have the imaging done and consult your local Orthopedic surgeon. Requirement of conservative management or surgery will be decided by him. For any further query please write back to us. Regards."}

I don t understand why they cant find and answer,", "response": "Hello! I understand your concern and would explain that fluttering and heart palpitations could be related to potential arrhythmia episodes, which may be very infrequent and impossible to detect in routine ECG monitoring. In such case, a more prolonged heart rhythm monitoring (a week Holder) or a loop recorder could be beneficial results in this regard by detecting rate arrhythmic episodes. Another alternative of chest fluttering not related to a cardiac arrhythmia may be diaphragm fluttering or intercostal muscles myoclonic. In case no cardiac arrhythmia is concluded, then you should discuss with your attending doctor on the above-mentioned alternatives. Hope to have been helpful to you! Kind regards,"}

{"query": "Hi my galfriend was using triphasil and the nurse gave her trigastrel now saying its the same, she ended trphasil with a brown pill( Which has meds) and started the trigastrel with a red ( No meds) is the a chance she will be pregnant because of thses changes and how long does she have to wait b4 unprotected sex ?", "response": "Hello, Though both the pills have the same combination, the bio-availability may differ and hence, protected intercourse is ideal in this cycle. She may start without additional protection from next cycle onward. It is difficult to say if she has conceived already during this cycle. You have to wait until her expected period and go for further investigation if she does not see her period.

{"query": "Hi, My baby is 21 days old and is having loose motions.He is on top feed.My doctor has asked me to give him enterogermina oral suspension (1/2 bottle twice for 3 days) and Taxim 0 (5ml for 3 days).Are these medicenes/antibiotics fine for such a small baby.", "response": "I understand your concerns. Are you also breastfeeding him? Usually it is normal for breastfed babies to have some loose stools. If you are breastfeeding him, there is no need to give probiotics like Enterogermina. Also, Taxi O is usually started only if they have blood in stools or high fever. These medicines are safe for small babies but if there is no blood in stools, my recommendation is that you can stop the medicines If top feeds are being given by bottle, I would suggest you change to a cup and spoon or palatal (or garage feeds) as bottles, even if sterilized well have more chance of harboring germs. Also check that you are giving the correct dilution of 1 scoop formula in 30 ml water, as over dilution can cause loose stools. Make sure you wash your hands well after cleaning the baby, and before giving feeds. My last recommendation is that you give him rotavirus vaccination from the age of two months, to protect him from rotavirus diarrhea. Warning signs which should make you take him for a review to the pediatrician"}

{"query": "Hello Dr. I have been having lower back pain for a while now. I did visit couple of orthopaedic doctors in , which did an Xray and ruled out any disc problem. They did say it is posture related. The pain is not very high, however it is consistent and very annoying. The medication and the gel/oil/physiotheraphy has not given me any relief.", "response": "Hi, Welcome to the forum. According to the description the back pain could be part of a mechanical back pain complex of symptoms.

This will help to relieve the possible muscle spasm which causes the pain. MRI can be taken in case you have any nerve compression symptoms or as deemed necessary by your Orthopedic. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for regards."}

He also did not have much of an appetite or motivation to do things he enjoys. His blood pressure was 168/100 at work today.", "response": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. It is important to know the age of your husband to comment on his blood pressure. Any person over 70 years will have blood pressure up to 150/ 90 mm Hg.

Please provide him adequate amounts of fluids and juices so that any other smaller stone stuck anywhere along his urinary tract might be passed out. Medicines need to be given to control his blood pressure. If his blood pressure is consistently high then please discuss with his doctor and try and know if he is taking any medicines which might increase the blood pressure.

In addition, I suffer from seizure-like episodes, temporary paralysis of my my body, spasms, excessive, salty, bitter saliva in the afternoon and evenings, which precede the episodes. All began 9 months ago with a severe tooth infection and woke up day after root canal with terrible vertigo , nausea, heart palpitations, tachycardia. Was dx with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome despite the condition not being dependent upon positioning. Sent to university cardiologist who said not POTS but rather inappropriate sinus tachycardia . Started and tried on various beta blockers. These symptoms progressed to knee weakness, crawling sensation on thighs, and tremor in arms....three weeks later i woke up saw the room tilt onto its side, bright flashes of light and paralyzed (still breathing) (5 months ago) unable to move an inch of my body, lay there not knowing what to do. Then my entire body spasmed and locked up (my right foot was frozen in position of big toe up, little toes down, ankle inverted for 3 weeks), leg shook, left arm down to hand shook uncontrollably...unable to move my body, feed myself, do anything for three weeks, my entire body became atrophied and had been to three hospitals, a skilled nursing facility twice, am now at an intensive rehab where I am recieving OT, PT, speech therapy, recreation therapy and neuropsych therapy. MRI, EEG, CT scans negative...neurologists have refused to do a lumbar puncture or mRA on me (history of aneurysm runs maternally) drs have stopped looking for the cause - despite the blurred vision, waves, 3D-like vision, cloudiness, grayness...etc 3 months ago, I woke up unable to speak. 2 weeks ago I woke up unable to see correctly. Severe, agonizing pain behind my left eye travels down left side of face, numbs nose, pain in ear, down into neck and shoulder, sometimes left eye gets stuck closed during spasm, but when open everything is too bright and distorted. Right eye things are dimmer, cant make out details, only see shapes and shadows. When eyes are open together unable to focus and experiencing double vision.

When I have these seizure like episodes, i lose time, am unable to remember at least a days time. The vision is what is scaring me the most right now. I am regaining strength throughout my body, but the pain, and the disturbed vision has me very worried. I am unsure why no doctor will not do a full work-up on me. i had half EMG done to test my nerves and muscles which were normal. I ve had cort-stim test, tilt table, haltermonitor, event monitor, lab work upon lab work, evoked EEG, then 6 hrs worth of 24 hr EEG when the machine broke, CT scan - but no other neuro diagnostic tests.

It can be diagnosed with an ultrasound scan of the heart (echo). The ECG may have signs of pericarditis, but they may be lacking sometimes. The pain with deep breaths also fits with pericarditis. Check with your cardiologist if you've done an echo already. You can contact me again, if you'd like any clarification or further information. Kind Regards!"}

As a Urologist, let me assure you that, the color changes you're seeing, are quite normal after treatment of Arianism. You could've reported to ER much earlier.  The discoloration is due to the congestion and blood clots, that had collected inside. One complication that may occur after treatment, is erectile dysfunction.I'm sure the ER doctor may have told you that. The black color you describe, is difficult to make out. You should see a Urologist for that. You can send a photo of the penis to me, for an expert opinion. Chat Doctor.  Manga."}

The information is not enough. But still, I would try to answer. The red marks could either be infected boils which are caused due to certain bacteria or viruses, or they could be simple petechial/purpuric spots (small bleeding spots) but in that case they are unlikely to have a yellow top. Information on whether there is associated fever would have been helpful. It is hard to comment further without looking at them and without knowing whether they are itchy.

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

{"query": "I am Tania. age 28. Just did ultra sound today. According to LMP I am 7weeks 2 days pregnent, but Ultra sound says indication of 6 weeks. Uterus is anteverted and gravid, yolk sac seen, Early fetal pole visualized, no cardiac activity. I am worried why no heart beat?", "response": "Hello, and I hope I can help you today. There are two possibilities of what may be going on if you do not yet see a heartbeat with your pregnancy. The first, even though you are sure of your LMP, conception can take place at a different time in your cycle than you expected.  The egg can live inside you up to 72 hours after ovulation, and sperm can remain alive inside you for up to 5 days.  So you actually may have conceived a week later than you thought, which means that you are only 6 weeks pregnant.  It can be normal to not see a heartbeat at 6 weeks. The other possibility is that the fetus died already at 6 weeks, which is a miscarriage that has not come out yet. The way we can figure out what is going on is to check another ultrasound in a week or so.  If there is no heartbeat by 7 weeks, then the diagnosis of a miscarriage is correct. So I know it is hard to be patient, but there is nothing that can be done to prevent miscarriage.  One of every 10 pregnancies are miscarriages, meaning 90 percent of the time after a miscarriage women go on to have a healthy baby. I hope I was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you. Best wishes, and good luck with the pregnancy,"}
{"query": "I dry swallowed my birth control pill this morning and I don t think it went down. I believe it s stuck up my nose somewhere. One of my nostrils feels slightly blocked, although I can still pass air in and out. Please help! Should I take another pill?", "response": "Hallow Dear, Even though you have swallowed birth control pill without water, it would not go into the nostrils. Nostrils are at higher level than throat. It will go through the throat into the stomach or respiratory tract. If it gets stuck up in the respiratory tract, you would have become breathless and have had cough. Then you would have become very serious. Do not worry, it has gone in your stomach. The pills are quite sizable as compared to nostrils. So if at all it goes in to the nostrils, it will block the nostril completely. Before the pill was swallowed, it caused some inflammation which has given you feeling of partial nasal blockage. Take steam inhalations through nostrils, and they will be clear. I hope this quietens you."}

{"query": "My son took a hockey puck on the front of his shin bone 4 weeks ago. It now appears he has a small lump right on the front of the shin where he took the puck. It is a hard lump, but he is experiencing no discomfort. Could it be a hematoma collected there, or callous material?", "response": "Hi ! Good morning. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Even though a clinical examination would be more helpful, with the history described, most likely your son did have a hematoma due to the trauma, which possibly got organized/calcified to give it a hard consistency.

I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.

{"query": "Hi. I am on my third month of birth control pills. I was prescribed Lo Estrin Fe and have been taking them since February. I started the pack right when I got them, after my cycle. That month I had a period, however it was in the third week of the pills. My doctor suggested that was normal, and that my next period should come around the end of the pack- near the white and brown pills. This month, it did not. I had very little cramping, and a tad bit of blood, but nothing like I am used to. Also, I had a gelatinous brown substance that I saw when using the restroom. Should I be worried?", "response": "Hello, I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is common to observe menstrual irregularities during the first three cycles after the initiation of the contraception. This is because the body takes time to adjust to the altered hormone milieu. If the breakthrough bleeding is persistent or heavy, please contact your health care provider for further management. Also, you need to use additional protection like condom or spermicide during the initial couple of months after the pill. If not, you carry a higher risk of failure. I would ask you to get a proper clinical appraisal and also exclude pregnancy. Take care."}

Sounds like you have Allergic response to cold - Allergic rhinitis and Bronchial Asthma. The former(allergic rhinitis) is allergic response from your upper respiratory tract because of which your Eustachian tube (auditory tube which has one of its opening behind the nose and the other opening into the ear) might have got blocked making you feel some loss of hearing.  Bronchial asthma is allergic response from your lower respiratory tract (windpipe and airways) which causes your airways to constriction temporarily on exposure to cold, dust, pollen or any allergen.  This construction of airways makes it difficult for the air that u breathe in and out to move along. Also, these airways swell up as a part of the allergic response producing more mucus, thus causing more cough n phlegm. Do your symptoms typically increase after exposure to such allergens I have mentioned ? Is this the first episode or u have had similar episodes in the past too ? Anybody else in your family had similar complaints . Coz since there's a genetic component to allergy, the presence of similar complaints in your parents / grandparents / other family members makes bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis more likely. As far as your stomach symptoms are concerned, many patients with asthma also have this reflux disease (medically called HERD). For symptom relief you will need steam inhalation antihistamine/ decongestant medication for allergic rhinitis. For Bronchial Asthma, based on physician assessment of your asthma severity, Inhaled bronchodilator Chat Doctor.  Refrain from taking cold"}

{"query": "My mother whenever she goes to temple or puja or heard mantras, she behaves differently. As someone came and says something as shown in films..god comes into people and they speak. May i know how severity is this problem ? I believe it is some mental disorder. Can anyone clarify ?", "response": "Hi, I went through your query and from what you have mentioned, it seems your mother is suffering from a disorder termed as dissociative trance and possession disorder. It is a condition in which a persons' behavior suddenly changes and acts as if he or she is being possessed by a god or even a devil, and they speak in slightly different tone as if the god or devil was speaking. It usually happens due to some underlying unconscious conflict which goes on in a persons head and remains persistent due to the attention being received from others due to the episodes, which acts as maintaining factor. Most people in our cultural setting believe it to occur due to religious factors and hence, don't seek proper treatment. I would recommend that you seek psychiatric consultation for initiating treatment. Medications including anti-depressants might help. More importantly, it will be important to understand the underlying conflict. As family members, you can help her by reducing the attention given to her during the episodes. The praying and offering things by others must stop during the episodes. I do hope that I was able to answer your query. Best wishes."}

Were you on any antibiotics? Some antibiotics can reduce the effect of contraceptive pill. There is a very small chance of method failure even when you take the pills correctly.

Sort of hard to describe, but I can feel it through my chest like a small *thud*. At the same moment I lose my breath. It only last 1-2...", "response": "Hello and thank you for using Chat Doctor. I carefully read your question and I totally understand your concern. But you should not worry. These skipped beats have to do with some electrical issues in the heart. Some electrical impulses that generate in a part of the heart different from normal sinus rhythm cause a premature heart contraction that you feel like a skipped beat, because it's not a normal one. When you experience a skipped beat it is normal to feel the palpitation, a discomfort, difficulties in breathing deeply. This extra-sistolik beats generally are followed by a pause till the next normal heart contraction. If these are not frequent, in Young and normal heart, it is nothing to worry about. There are different factors that might cause this skipped beats like emotional stress, excessive coffee consumption, coca-cola or energy Chat Doctor. Pathology like anemia or hyperthyroidism might be other causes. So, if I was your treating doctor I would say that you have nothing to worry if this happens once a wile, its normal. But if they begin to bother you and interfere in your live we can decide to do some examinations like a blood analyze, your thyroid hormones, an electrocardiogram, echocardiography and of course a holder rhythm monitoring to have a full view of your rhythm and the extra-sistolik beat frequencies. Onliest than we can decide what we should do. Hope I was helpful. Best regards."}

{"query": "Hello doctor,my problem is that I have over-sensitive glans and I can t touch it.Even though I am afraid to retract my foreskin because it causes big discomfort.i can t retract my foreskin when I m erect. What can I do for the sensitivity?? It s so annoying and almost painful.", "response": "Hi, Thanks for writing in. A hypersensitive penis is seen in many people. The head of penis as such is a very sensitive structure and in some people it is even more hypersensitive. This can cause erections at the slightest touch and become an embarrassment. Also, it can lead to problems like difficulty in retracting the fore skin. You can try applying lidocaine 2 percent gel to the tip of your penis during sex. This will not allow the penis to get hyperactive, and you can enjoy sexual intercourse. Also use lots of lubricants so that the foreskin is easily retractable. If you can't retract the foreskin even with lubrication then please do not try and retract with force. This can damage the foreskin, and it is better to see the urologist if you can't retract completely after applying lubrication gel."}

I get it about once every 6 months to a year and it only seems to happen when I m stressed. What could it be?", "response": "Hi ! Good evening. I am Chat Doctor answering your query. Most likely it is a benign tumor. There are very many organs and structures in the front of the neck, and the lump could arise from any of these which could be known only by a physical examination.

The thicker mucosa could be because of frictional keratitis or leukoplakia or niche plans or candidiasis. Consult an oral physician get the above said conditions ruled out. If it is frictional keratitis, remove the cause like sharp teeth by rounding off the sharp edges. If it is candidiasis then you have to take topical antifungal like candid mouth paint. If it is leukoplakia, you have to stop the habit of smoking and take antioxidants like capsule lycopene. If it is lichen plans then you have to take topical steroids like triamcinolone acetone (0.1%) 4-5times daily for 1 week. I hope my answer will help you, take care."}

In addition, the symptoms of the patient like fever spikes are taken into consideration to determine the duration of antibiotic course. It is not uncommon to change the antibiotic in non-responding patients.  This is due the fact that, most microorganisms have developed resistance to various antibiotics including typhoid causing bacteria particularly in the endemic zones. The duration of treatment depends on variety of factors like bacterial load, sensitivity to antibiotics, patient condition and underlying co-morbidity(if any). Average patient, with no underlying health issues and on appropriate antibiotics recover fully in about 6-8 weeks. The heavy dose of antibiotics is crucial to control the infection and to prevent complications in typhoid patients like intestinal perforations, peritonitis, ulcers in the intestine and neurological complications with spread to brain.

Once her nutrition condition improves, all her condition will go off, and she can have good immunity to fight against the infection. Thank you."}

Her DOTA pet scan shoes poorly differentiated lesion in IV segment of liver. Can you guide us on wat this could mean. Will the treatment be chemotherapy or surgery . Will my mother improve with chemo.", "response": "Hi, How are you? My name is Chat Doctor.  I am a Liver and Pancreas specialist and I hope to answer your question today. I am sorry to hear about your mothers' diagnosis. It is unusual for GAVE to occur by itself and is usually a symptom of Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension or chronic Liver failure. But given your mothers history she does not seem to be suffering from either of these conditions. The treatment of GAVE is usually done by endoscopic coagulation with which excellent results have been obtained. It is very rare for it to need surgery to treat it. Given the lesion in the liver, she will need to undergo a colonoscopy as well to look for the primary lesion. If all the reports appear normal, and only the isolated segment 4 lesions of the liver is present, then it is very much necessary to get it surgically removed. Since it is a single lesion, the surgery is pretty straight forward. Please do let me know where you reside, so I can guide you to any available specialists in your area. Hope this helps and hope your mother starts to feel better."}

I am living with a lot of guilt bec I went to nursing school and never saw this coming. His ejection fraction was only 15 %", "response": "Hi welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your query and concern. Your father symptoms are suggestive of Congestive cardiac failure leading to pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock thereby death. Congestive heart failure has poor prognosis in all cases if the ejection fraction is under 30%. If he had got urgent hospitalization he would have recovered.It's always advisable to keep the blood pressure under 130/80 mm of Hg. I advise my patients to have a baseline 2 dimensional echocardiography, ECG,HS CRP and lipid profile to assess the basic cardiac reserve of your heart to avoid these complications. Restrict the intake of salt to less than 6gm/day. Chat Doctor. Semiannual follow-ups are advisable on maintenance for people who have crossed 40s is helpful.

But decision to go for a transplant depends on several factors. Matched donor is one such factor in allogenic transplant. Repeated blood transfusion before transplant increases failure chance. Although young patients like you are a good candidate for transplant the decision entirety depends on individual situation. Recently various research have shown chromosomal structure(telomere) also has an impact on outcome of the therapy chosen.  So it is complex decision.  If were your treating physician I had suggested you to consult a hematologist for best judgment.  Wish you good health."}

Could burning wood in a fireplace also cause this result? 57 years old female diagnosed with Asthma at 3-about years old.

In case of hyperventilation, there is increased accumulation of carbon dioxide in blood. Asthma can lead to complications associated with respiratory systems. Thus, elevated carbon dioxide can be due to asthma. You need to consult your pulmonologist for clinical assessment, relevant investigations and thus management. Thanks and take care Chat Doctor."}

My blood pressure machine sometimes shows an irregular heart beat. I wore a monitor one weekend but nothing ever showed Thanksjs", "response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern. Since your cardiologist consultation is normal, no need to worry about cardiac cause for your breathlessness. In my opinion, we should rule out pulmonary causes.

{"query": "First I went in for small filling on upper left 2nd molar 1 month ago. Ever since then I have crazy pain when I eat or drink hot or cold. Last week dentist could not understand why I had pain cause it was such a small filling but after examination he started a root canal saying that this will relieve any sensitivity and I would get immediate relief . Its been about 6 days now and I have excruciating pain 24/7 Im taking both Morton 800 and Tylenol codeine #300 and amoxacilyn but no relief whats so  ever. This morning the dr checked me. First he pushed hard on the gums around the area and I felt no pain. Then he pushed hard with his finger on the tooth and I felt no pain. The dr could not believe it. He then touched the tooth with a pick and I had pain. He proceeded to open the tooth by taking out the temporary filling without novacane and saw no puss and no infection. He claims I just dont tolerate pain very well. He also said he will not even attempt to finish the root canal until my pin subsides. Could my dentist be missing something? Im just not buying when he said that its just that I cant handle pain that well cause on a scale of 1-10 my pain was at an 11! 24 hours a day ever since that first treatment. What could it be what can I do??? Please help Im a nervous wreck in so much pain.", "response": "Hello! Thank you for posting here. You did not mention if you had any pain in that tooth before the small filling. This tooth can be a case of vertical fracture. Fracture lines can be often missed in the radiograph and lead to unexpected pain and discomfort in the tooth. You did not mention if you grind your teeth in the night. Your dentist is right in not proceeding unless there is a relief in the pain. Completing the root canal will merely be namesake and there will be no improvement in the pain relief. I suggest you to get this clarified with your dentist. Hope this helps."}

I have some marvelon that I havent taken before should I take one of those?", "response": "Hello, I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If you add the intercourse during the safe period, you do not need any emergency contraception. However, if you are around the fertile or ovulation period, you need to take emergency contraception if you do not wish a pregnancy.

Any ideas?Ive had breathing tests and dont have asthma  YYYY@YYYY", "response": "Thanks for your question on Chat Doctor. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) is normal, no need to worry about asthma. Possibility of lung Infection or pleural effusion is more in your case. Constant coughing is seen in both of them.

{"query": "Hello Ive developed a rash of sorts. It started with a red bump on my abdomen that has now proceeded to become a flat dark dry patch (10mm x 20mm) that is still itchy. Other similar lesions have cropped up on my thighs and inner arms though smaller.The only thing that has changed recently is that Ive cut out a lot of processed foods and am drinking green juice regularly (kale cucumber celery and raw plant protein powder). Im a vegetarian. I used a topical over the counter steroid cream which helped temporarily. The rashes have been there for two weeks now.", "response": "Welcome to Chat Doctor Forum Seems like you have developed Satyriasis Rose(PR)PR manifests as an acute, self-limiting, papulosquamous eruption with a duration of 6-8 weeks. PR has been linked to upper tract respiratory infections. The disease typically begins with a solitary patch, usually salmon-colored, that heralds the eruption and thus is commonly referred to as the herald patch or spot. This initial lesion enlarges over a few days to become a patch with a collate of fine scale just inside the well-demarcated border. Within the next 1-2 weeks, a generalized exanthem usually appears, although it may occur from hours to months after the herald patch. This secondary phase consists of bilateral and symmetric lesions with scales. This phase tends to resolve over the next 6 weeks, but variability is common. Pruritus is commonly evident in 25-75% of patients and usually of mild-to-moderate severity. The eruption is symmetric and most commonly involves the thorax, back, abdomen, and adjoining areas of the neck and extremities. As is a self-limited disease; treatment is supportive. Topical zinc oxide and calamine lotion are useful for pruritic. If the disease is severe or widespread, topical or oral steroids may be used. The skin rash may take 6-8 weeks to clear up completely. You can take oral antihistamines like levocetrizine for pruritic. Hope it helps Chat Doctor."}
{"query": "Earlier at work I hit my ankle hard on a metal corner and it s only a little swollen and a slight bruise. Now it hurts a lot to walk and I feel a pull when I bring my foot upward. . Would you know if it s serious and also I m only 22 years old. Thanks", "response": "Hello, Can't possibly know if it is serious without an examination. And, inflammation occurs after the injury and increases. This causes accumulation of tissue fluid (swelling) the swelling causes the joint to be (temporarily mostly) deformed by the tissue fluid and less mobile.  The tissue fluid distorts the area and makes it pull. Warm water causes resorption of the fluid. Elevation moves it out by gravity and deep water submersion pushes it out. So, warm water soak in deep water such as a pool usually helps fairly quickly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care"}

Followup with reticulocyte count after 15 days of starting treatment would show increase in reticulocyte percentage. Start immediately on it B12 and iron therapy.4. If masturbation is affecting routine life, then you will require counseling. Hope it helps. Any further queries, happy to help again."}

{"query": "HI my mom is suffering from multiple myeloma and undergoing treatment for the same.I just wanna ask about the importance of serum beta 2 microglobulin test and its importance in the disease mentioned above b coz inspite of others tests being normal ,this test always shows a higher value.please answer .I will be thankful to you.", "response": "Hi and thanks for the question. Beta 2 microglobuilin is a small protein associated with multiple myeloma. In course of this disease, some chains of particular antibodies, including Beta 2 micrglobulin are produced. The quantity or concentration of this substance in blood gives an indication of the stage of the disease, and measures the outcome or prognosis. The lower the concentrations of this substance, the better the outcome. It is therefore measured to know the stage of the disease and to monitor the evolution of the patient under treatment. Increasing values imply that the treatment is not very effective, whereas decreasing values implies the effectiveness, and good prognosis of the patient. It is actually a measure of the morbidity and the mortality of the disease. Thanks and hope this helps, Luchuo, MD."}

As per your symptoms you are having orthodontic relapse. After finishing the orthodontic treatment the teeth tend to move back to its original position, so a retainer is given to patient (removable or fixed) to hold the teeth in the new position.

Now that relapse has occurred in your case, you need to go again for orthodontic therapy that is fixed or removable depending on the severity. If minor correction has to be done better go for removable. If enough space is not there to align the teeth then to gain the space extraction of premolars (to gain more space) or proximal stripping (to gain less space) has to do. And yes, orthodontic treatment can definitely be done at this age. It's called Adult orthodontics.

Firstly, let me express my appreciation for the grace with which you have accepted facts. In the current scenario, endometrium is not congenial for launching of a fertilized ovum. Also, you seem to have the difficulty of ovulation as evidenced by the failure and infection of the ovary also has to be excluded, since tuberculosis often affects the pelvic organs together. You cannot plan for a pregnancy until you are free of the disease and all treatment stopped. The diarrhea can be a side effect of the medication. Regular monitoring throughout treatment is mandatory. Hope this helps."}

There are multiple reasons for these elevations-Few conditions which mild elevation in liver enzymes include Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Infectious mononucleosis which are viral infections, being overweight, taking OTC Chat Doctor. We need to exclude some other possibilities for elevation of AST, ALT(liver enzymes) like Alcoholic hepatitis and due to excess fats such as- Cholelithiasis (Gall bladder stones), Cholecystitis (inflammation of gall bladder), autoimmune hepatitis, Hypothyroidism etc. Usually, there would be 10 - 100 times than that of normal, GOT and SGPT elevation in case of acute hepatitis and If you like my answers and wish me to answer in the future, bring it to my attention"}

Apart from that it is difficult to comment really as to why he is in unconscious state. The treating doctors who are aware of his blood reports, scans etc. only may be able to tell it clearly. You may have to just wait and watch and pray at this moment. Heart valve replacement is a major surgery with its own set of associated risks. We hope for the best. Good luck."}

Its efficacy when taking at most 48 hours after intercourse is greater than 80% in preventing pregnancies, and even more when taken earlier.

Combining a such times with other methods like the condom could be advisable. However, there are some slim chances that you might get pregnant.

Yeast in stools in an active child with no other illness is a perfectly normal finding. It just happens because it may be a part of normal gut flora. There is no need for treatment. Normally, infants show great variations in poops in terms of frequency, consistency and color. Green poops usually occur due to excess lactose in feeds. In a breastfed child its due to more intake of fore milk than hind milk. So, just a proper and complete breastfeeding can easily treat your nephew. In case he is on formula feeds, then ensure proper dilution and hygiene. Hopefully this will help you. I would be happy to help you in any further questionsTake care"}
